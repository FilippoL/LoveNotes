# Progress: LoveNotes

## What Works
- ✅ Memory bank structure created and documented
- ✅ Project vision and technical architecture defined
- ✅ Expo project initialized with TypeScript
- ✅ Firebase project structure configured (rules, indexes, functions)
- ✅ GitHub repository structure with CI/CD
- ✅ Development environment fully configured
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation created

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Firebase project setup
- [x] GitHub repository structure
- [x] Development environment configuration

### Phase 2: Core Systems ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Authentication flow ✅
- [x] Encryption system (key generation, exchange, encryption/decryption) ✅
- [x] Partner connection system (invite codes, pairing logic) ✅
- [x] Card data models and Firestore structure ✅
- [x] Card rotation algorithm ✅
- [x] PartnerContext for state management ✅

### Phase 3: Main App Features ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Card creation (text + voice + templates) ✅
- [x] Card drawing with cooldown logic ✅
- [x] Deck rotation algorithm ✅
- [x] History and card sharing ✅
- [x] Breakup functionality ✅
- [x] Connect Screen with QR codes ✅
- [x] Home Screen with Add/Draw buttons ✅
- [x] Create Card Screen (text/voice/templates) ✅
- [x] View Card Screen with decryption and voice playback ✅
- [x] Settings Screen with logout/breakup ✅
- [x] Share Card feature (Expo-compatible) ✅
- [x] SafeAreaView on all screens ✅

### Phase 4: Polish & Production (Pending)

- [ ] Security audit

## Current Status
**Phase 1 - Setup & Infrastructure**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Phase 2 - Core Systems**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Phase 3 - Main App Features**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Phase 1 Deliverables Summary
- ✅ Complete Expo + TypeScript project structure
- ✅ Firebase configuration (Firestore, Storage, Auth, Functions)
- ✅ Comprehensive security rules
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Development tooling (ESLint, Jest, TypeScript)
- ✅ Project documentation (README, setup guides, encryption guide)
- ✅ Directory structure for scalable architecture

## Known Issues
- ESLint configuration fixed (removed invalid react-native environment)
- react-native-view-shot replaced with Expo-compatible sharing solution
- All screens now use SafeAreaView to prevent content overlap with device notch/camera
