# Product Context: LoveNotes

## Why This Project Exists
LoveNotes addresses the need for intentional, private appreciation in relationships. In a world of constant communication, meaningful connection gets lost. This app creates a sacred space for two people to nurture their bond through deliberate appreciation.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Lack of intentional appreciation**: Daily rhythms prioritize problem-solving over affirmation
2. **Privacy concerns**: Intimate expressions deserve protection
3. **Overwhelming communication**: Too many platforms dilute meaningful connection
4. **Gamification of relationships**: Reduces genuine appreciation to metrics

## How It Should Work

### User Flow
1. User registers/logs in with email or phone
2. User generates or scans invite code to connect with partner
3. Once connected, user can:
   - **Add**: Create a new card (text or voice) with optional templates
   - **Pick**: Draw a random card from partner's unread deck (15-min cooldown)
4. Cards cycle through deck completely before reshuffling
5. Users can share cards via device share menu
6. Breakup feature allows clean severance if needed

### Emotional Principles
- **Anticipation Builds Meaning**: 15-minute cooldown transforms receiving into ceremony
- **Completion Before Repetition**: Every card received before any repeat
- **Balance Through Limitation**: Only two actions (give or receive)
- **Voice Humanizes**: Audio preserves emotional texture lost in text

## User Experience Goals
- **Minimalist**: Two main buttons reduce cognitive load
- **Beautiful**: Card templates with animations and custom designs
- **Respectful**: Privacy and security as core values, not afterthoughts
- **Emotionally Considerate**: Every feature designed with vulnerability in mind
- **Reliable**: Technical stability so intimacy isn't disrupted

## Target Audience
Couples or close partners seeking a private, intentional way to express and receive appreciation. Not designed for public sharing or social networking.

## Core Philosophy
This isn't about gamifying affection; it's about ritualizing attention. The app is a vessel—a carefully designed emptiness that two people fill with quiet, daily acts of seeing and celebrating each other.
